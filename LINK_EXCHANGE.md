Hello. Currently exchanging links with friends or mutual follows :sparkles:. 

If you are a friend and would like to exchange links, please [send a pull request](https://github.com/jlord/jlord/edit/master/README.md) to add your banner. 

Your banner should be an 88x31px (176x62 @2x) rectanglar image, and be wrapped in a link to your GitHub profile page. The image can theoritically be an animated GIF, but please don't use anything too distracting. If you want to use a white background, please add a border so it would not float in space. Finally, in the code, make sure to give the image tag fixed dimensions.

---

In exchange, put my banner somewhere in your internet spaces. It's hosted on my domain so in the future I can update it without bothering you. You just gotta trust me.
